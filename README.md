# publish-stack-primary-vault

The Dendron vault containing the stub notes, the ones ready to be published will be sent to the secondary-vault.

Part of the publish-stack project alongside:

- [publish-stack-blog](https://github.com/AndreaBinelli/publish-stack-blog)
- [publish-stack-secondary-vault](https://github.com/AndreaBinelli/publish-stack-secondary-vault)

## Concepts

- New notes will be created in this vault
- From stubs to well written notes, then moved to the secondary-vault when I want to publish them
- Can be private (in this case it is because it's the proof of concept...)
